# CS157C_Airbnb Ratings and Analysis using MongoDB

This project focuses on Airbnb ratings and analysis of different Airbnbs worldwide. The main use case of the Airbnb data set is that the customer finds the housing based on the requirements. Schema for the dataset is unstructured and will cause a lot of redundancy if stored in RDBMS. Moreover, since the use cases are read intensive, NoSQL deployment allows us to build the index on the data. MongoDB also helps in scaling this data and allows flexible insertions.
